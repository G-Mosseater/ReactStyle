                Elephants are the largest land animals, known for their
                intelligence, strong social bonds, and unique physical features,
                like their long trunks and large ears. They play a crucial role
                in ecosystems, creating water holes and spreading seeds that
                promote forest growth."

              <AccordionContent>
                Flying foxes are large fruit bats known for their fox-like
                faces, expansive wingspans, and vital ecological role in
                pollinating plants and dispersing seeds. Theyâ€™re often found
                roosting in large colonies in trees, mainly feeding on fruit and
                nectar.

                Python snakes are large, non-venomous constrictors found
                primarily in Africa, Asia, and Australia. Known for their
                strength and impressive size, some species, like the reticulated
                python, can grow over 20 feet long. Pythons are skilled hunters,
                using their muscular bodies to coil around and suffocate their
                prey before swallowing it whole.
